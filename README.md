## Project work 3

1. Project work "Mesto" (sprint 4-9).

2. An interactive page where you can add photos, delete them, put likes. Part of the logic is written in JavaScript (appearance of pop-up windows, form validation, adding cards, etc.). In the *5th sprint* we implemented opening/closing and pop-up functionality for adding elements, removing them, as well as pop-up with a lightbox image. In *6th sprint* we developed form validation and improved UX when working with pop-ups. *Sprint 7* - code refactoring, getting started with OOP and modules (added Card and FormValidator classes). *8 sprint* - code rewritten in accordance with OOP, modular code built using Webpack. *9 sprint* - the site is connected to api. Improved ux/ui components.

3. Applied technologies:
  - flexbox;
  - grid layout;
  - adaptive layout;
  - form validation;
  - The code is written according to OOP;
  - module builder (Webpack) is used.

4. System preferences: HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript; web-browser (dev browser – Opera), module bundler – Webpack.
